# AppRExp governance

## About this document

This is an overview of the governance and key people involved in AppRexp.

## What is AppRExp?

AppRExp (the "Organization") is a non-profit organization that aims to foster sustainable free and open-source projects created by the Singapore community. We strive towards this goal by actively partaking in the development of the involved project and providing opiniated guidance on the technical implementations of the project. We aim to offload the difficulty of discovering and implementing FOSS best practices, therefore freeing the Core Contributors to focus on improving their project(s).
